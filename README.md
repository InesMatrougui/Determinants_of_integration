# Determiant_of_integration
Determiant_of_integration includes R scripts that process data in the same way as in Matrougui et al. (2025).

It is composed of several scripts, located in `src/`, to run in the same order as listed here. The scripts process the number of integrations and sequencing depth specifically to determine the factors influencing genomic polydnavirus integration.

In `examples/`, one can find examples of files needed to run the scripts. Examples are given for chimeric reads between CtBV (bracoviruses of Cotesia typhae) and the leiptoptera Sesamia nonagrioides.
