# Determiant_of_integration
Determiant_of_integration includes R scripts that process data in the same way as in Matrougui et al. (2025).

It is composed of several scripts, located in `src/`, to run in the same order as listed here. The scripts process the number of integrations and sequencing depth specifically to determine the factors influencing genomic polydnavirus integration.

In ‘examples/’, you will find examples of files needed to run the scripts. Examples are provided for the number of integrations and sequencing depth of host-wasp systems involving four species of Cotesia wasps and five species of lepidopteran hosts. All of this data was produced using Chimera and WorkflowBowBlast pipelines https://github.com/HeloiseMuller/Chimera https://github.com/HeloiseMuller/WorkflowBowBlast.
