# Determiant_of_integration
Determiant_of_integration includes R scripts that process data in the same way as in Matrougui et al. (2025).

It is composed of several scripts, located in `src/`, to run in the same order as listed here. The scripts process the number of integrations and sequencing depth specifically to determine the factors influencing genomic polydnavirus integration.

In `examples/`, you will find examples of files needed to run the scripts. Examples are provided for the number of integrations and sequencing depth of wasp-host systems involving four species of Cotesia wasps and five species of lepidopteran hosts.
